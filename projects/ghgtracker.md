summary: Greenhouse gas tracker where users are allowed to store their commutes and mode of transportation.

# Overview
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/ghgtracker/LandingPage.png">
For this semester's ICS 414 Software Engineering II class, we were assigned one major project in groups of 8 to 9 for the entire semester. We were task to create a greenhouse gas tracker website with Hawaiian Electric Industries, where it allows users to store their commutes and mode of transportation. In return, using the inputted information determines how much greenhouse gas they either produced or reduced. Alongside this main concept, we also added other aspects such as cumulative components for both individual users and all users.

# Contribution
During this project, I mainly focused on the Vehicles and MyVehicles collection. Users had to add their personal vehicle and based on the miles per gallon, we could calculate the green house gas produced or reduced if they rode alternative transportation. With the help of the collection web-scraped by one of my teammates, I was able to create a reactive form where the model depended on the selected make and the year depended on the selected make and model.

# Experience
What made this a unique project was that we were fully online. We never met in person, and our only form of communication was through discord, a messaging and talking platform. It took a while for my group to get moving, especially during the planning phases where we discussed the direction and layout of this project. This experience showed me the importance of having project management and communicating efficiently together. In addition, we were encouraged to meet at least twice a week to discuss the current progress of our milestone. This ensures constant planning and preventing overlaps and merge conflicts. It may seem tedious, but all these factors played a huge role in the completion of our project.

Other than coding, we also presented our website and progress to the class and during customer meetings. During this process, we received a lot of feedback and useful concepts that we incorporated. It was also amazing to see other groups and their ideas outside of the main concept of tracking userâ€™s commutes.
