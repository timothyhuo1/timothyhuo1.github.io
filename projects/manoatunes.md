summary: ICS 314 Project - A community platform that connects people with similar musical interests.
---

Like many others going into college, we had to sacrifice most of our hobbies, such as music to focus on school and the future. However, many students like me would like to express our musical creativity, and our group created a platform called Manoa Tunes to help students and faculty connect and share music for our ICS 314 final project.

Our two main focuses were profiles and jams. We wanted to let users have customized profiles that display their biography, musical interest, and the instruments they play. For jams, we wanted to let users create jam sessions and let others join and leave them. I worked on implementing the cards that display information about the jams and functionalities to allow users to join and leave them.  Also, I integrated commenting features that made writing reviews about a person possible. 

A challenging aspect at first was communication among everyone. In the beginning, our ideas and efforts overlapped, and we weren’t as efficient. Once we were all on the same page, we overcame obstacles, such as understanding how collections worked and how to manipulate them on other pages.

Manoa Tunes was my first software engineering project, and I’m lucky to have worked with these group members. Throughout the project, I picked many skills and technologies, such as issue-driven project management, Robo 3T, and Semantic UI, which helped us stay organized and on track.
