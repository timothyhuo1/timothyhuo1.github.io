HiTEA and Aloha Bowls and Tea are local businesses that serve food and drinks here in Hawaii. I created websites for both companies to help customers stay in touch and present more information about the company. Having a website is essential to stay connected with customers and promoting new products/services. 

HiTEA is located in The Lanai at Ala Moana that serves authentic Chinese food and fresh smoothies/teas. For HiTEA's website, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap hosted on AWS S3 and CloudFront. I also implemented the Clover POS component to allow customers to order online. HiTEA is the parent company of Aloha Bowls and Tea. See the website <a href="https://hitea808.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Aloha Bowls and Tea is located in Hilton Hawaiian Village that serves healthy and high-quality poke, acai, and smoothies/teas. 
For Aloha Bowls and Tea's website, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jekyll, and Sass hosted on GitHub Pages. See the website <a href="https://alohabowlsandtea.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

These two websites were the first projects I worked on dealing with web development. It helped me understand how a website works and the possibilities of web design. It is still a work in progress, as there are still so many things I want to incorporate.
