### Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge  
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/broadband/home-page.png">

The Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge (HACC) 2022 was a month-long hackathon from October to November. At the beginning of the HACC, participants formed teams and selected one of the given challenges. I joined a team of 6, and our tech stack was Meteor, React.js, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and Digital Ocean. We chose to work on All About Broadband, with the goal of gathering information from users as to concerns, hurdles to adoption, issues, or impacts to the use/non-use of technology.

Modern society has been increasingly reliant on technology for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, not everyone can access online services or are unfamiliar with connecting to and using the internet. Broadband for Hawaii is an interactive, accessible online platform that encourages people to learn more about the internet and technology through classes and workshops. Users can register for these activities, take quizzes, accumulate points and earn badges. Admins can create activities and view a dashboard showing a visualization of users’ data and survey results. I focused on the back end, setting up the database architecture and developing multiple functionalities, including classes/workshops, lessons, and an admin dashboard.
