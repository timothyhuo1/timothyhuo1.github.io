summary: A web application designed to help individuals track COVID symptoms and vaccination status.
---
LumiCamino is a web application designed to help individuals track COVID symptoms and vaccination status based on the UH Lumisight application. This meteor application helped us warm up our tech stack skills for the Meteor Hackathon and HACC. Our team consists of five members using Meteor, React.js, Semantic UI, MongoDB, and Galaxy as our tech stack.

# Application Description
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/lumicamino/home-page.png">
The home page includes sections to complete their daily check-in and displays a message about whether the user should or should not go to campus. This message is determined by the userâ€™s response to the daily check-in form. In addition, users could add and store their vaccine data on the application. The vaccine data form allows users to submit data on their vaccine status and upload a picture of their vaccine card.

For this application, I mainly focused on the back end. I focused on the vaccine data collection, daily check-in functionality, and adding vaccine data forms. This project structure was my first using a base collection from scratch, so it was interesting to see different strategies for publishing and adding to a collection.

This web application helped us get into the groove of working together and lay out a strategy for the hackathons based on our strengths. As hackathons approach, communication is essential since we have limited time to build and host an application. We have to prepare for common problems such as merge conflicts, miscommunication, and hosting issues.
