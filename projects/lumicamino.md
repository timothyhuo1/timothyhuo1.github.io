summary: A web application designed to help individuals track COVID symptoms and vaccination status.
---
LumiCamino is a web application designed to help individuals track COVID symptoms and vaccination status, similar to the UH Lumisight application. This meteor application is aimed to help us warm up our tech stack for the Meteor Hackathon and HACC. Our team is made out of five members using Meteor, React.js, Semantic UI, MongoDB, and Galaxy as our tech stack.

# Application Description
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/lumicamino/home-page.png">
Upon entering the site, the user is greeted by the landing page. The landing page provides users to option to sign up or sign in.
Once the user logs in, they are taken to their home page. The page includes a sections to complete their daily check-in, and displays a message about whether the user should or should not go to campus.
This message is determined by the userâ€™s response to the daily check in form.
In addition, there is a section that allows users to add their vaccine data. The vaccine data form allows users to submit data of their vaccine status and upload a picture to their vaccine card.

For this application, I mainly focused on the back-end. I set up the vaccine data collection and created the daily check-in and add vaccine data forms. This was my first using base collection from scratch so it was interesting to see simpler ways of doing things such as publishing and adding to a collection. One thing I learned from this experience was creating a MongoDB and hosting an application onto Galaxy. We had our fair share of problems trying to host and debug our application. It took us multiple tries to host but in the end, we figured out what our problems were and the solutions to them.

As a whole, this warm-up web application helped us get into the groove of working together and lay out a strategy for the hackathons based on our strengths. Going into our first hackathon, communication is essential especially since we have five days to build and host an application. We have to prepare for common problems such as merge conflicts, miscommunication, and hosting issues. After completing this application, we realize what we need to put in place to prevent future issues.
