# Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge  
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/hmarcamino/landing.png">

The Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge (HACC) was a month-long hackathon from October to November. At the beginning of the HACC, participants formed teams and selected one of the given challenges. I joined a team of 5 and our tech stack was Meteor, React.js, Semantic UI, MongoDB, and Galaxy. We chose to work on NIC Hawaii - Hawaii Marine Animal Response (HMAR) Sighting & Reporting App. This was the perfect challenge for us because it aligned with our passion and skillset. Currently, HMAR’s only means of collecting information on sightings or animals in distress is through a hotline number. However, according to HMAR, this comes with many issues including observers not being familiar with their current location, multiple calls on the same sightings, and many more.  

# HMARCamino and Personal Contribution

HMARCamino is an online reporting platform that helps HMAR volunteers and staff members organize and collect sighting reports from the general public. For this project, I mainly focused on the reporting system such as implementing basic functionality such as adding, editing, deleting, reviewing, and grouping reports. To help solve the problem of observers not being familiar with their current location, I implemented Google Maps API with places and geo-location.  Allowing users to pin their location on the Google Map and pick whether they want to share their current location to the web browser. If they decline to share, they can search the address/area, and the Google Map will pane to that specific location. This functionality allows the user a sense of privacy, and both options are efficient and user-friendly.

# Experience and What I learned 
At the start of the HACC, there were a lot of tasks that we had to address to meet their criteria throughout the hackathon. One thing that we learned was how to adapt and design our application around a client’s request. We couldn’t go straight into coding, and instead, gather all the necessary information and plan accordingly. There were times where we had to revisit a component and talk among each other to gain more insight on how to solve a particular issue. 

I was very fortunate to have a passionate team that was very organized and knew all the deadlines and what was due. Coding was only one of the main factors in this hackathon in terms of judging. On top of that, we had to present and sell our application multiple times to the technical reviewers and judges. While preparing for the presentation day, we understood the time limit that we had and the challenge of trying to present the issue and our solution in only five minutes. Organization and planning played a huge part in our success in this year’s HACC. I had an amazing time working with my teammates and was very happy to see the growth of everyone throughout this semester.
